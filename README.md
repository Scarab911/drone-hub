# Drone HUB React App

Hello my name is Paul'ius and this project is meant to showcase my web developement experience. I started from scratch and took a leap of faith that I'm also can learn REACT framework(was tougth ANGULAR before). My aproach was to do and learn things then stuck, as I know that part of web develoeprs job is to find answers online ^^.

### Key points:

- **CRUD**, website or an app with full operations, database and backend Node.js server for user authentification.
- **Routes**
- **Guards**
- **Components**
- **GitHub Issues**
- **Brances**
- **Not** responsive design?
- Design custom made by fresh UX designer Kestutis Lukosevicius.

### Techniques used:

- **JavaScript** (should go for typeScript)
- **CSS** (need to learn Tailwind and SCSS)
- **HTML**
- **REACT**

Design personal preference.

### Game assignment key points:

---

1. In our UI, the player should be able to play the game by clicking on buttons rather than
   typing their answer in a prompt.
2. Create three buttons, one for each selection. Add an event listener to the buttons that call
   your playRound function with the correct playerSelection every time a button is clicked.
   (you can keep the console.logs for this step)
3. Add a div for displaying results and change all of your console.logs into DOM methods.
4. Display the running score, and announce a winner of the game once one player reaches 5
   points.

### My personal additions:

---

- Design
- Text color changes depend on Win/Loss/Tie
- Reset button(if player eager to start over)
